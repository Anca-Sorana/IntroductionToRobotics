# IntroductionToRobotics

Hey there! This is my personal repository for "Introduction to Robotics" class assignments. It's where I organize, submit, and track my homework. Feel free to look around and follow my academic path in robotics as it unfolds.

## Homework no. 2

### Description
This homework is focused on gaining experience with potentiometers, Arduino, and RGB LEDs. You should learn how to control each RGB color (Red, Green, and Blue) individually using three potentiometers.

### Tasks Requirement
* **Potentiometer Control:** You will need to use separate potentiometers for Red, Green, and Blue to control the RGB LED colors.
* **Digital Electronics:** Learn how to use Arduino to read the potentiometer values.
* **Color Mapping:** After reading the potentiometer values, you will map and send these values to the LED pins to achieve precise color control.

The main code is presented [here](https://github.com/Anca-Sorana/IntroductionToRobotics/blob/main/Tema2/main_code/main_code.ino).

Here you can have a qiuck look at the setup I have:
